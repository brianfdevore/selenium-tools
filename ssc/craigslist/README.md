To use the Craigslist ad posting tool in this directory, do the following:

1. Run update_regions.py first to fetch the latest CL regions.  This process filters and organizes the regions into a json file which contains the region names and ids needed later for posting.

2. Verify that the images directory contains the correct images, and in the correct order.

3. Review the configuration in ./infiles/ad_config.json for ad creation and modify as needed.

4. When ready, run post_ads.py to publish the ads.
